Ego notes" can refer to psychological concepts (Freud's Id, Ego, Superego), personal growth ideas (managing ego for self-improvement, Transactional Analysis ego states), or short statements about self-worth and confidence (Instagram captions). In psychology, the ego is the rational self balancing desires (Id) and morals (Superego) using reality; for self-help, it's about controlling selfishness for growth; and in social media, it's about projecting strength, confidence, and high standards.
